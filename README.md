# sibyl

ML-inspired programming language for learning purposes.

The goals are for Sibyl to be:

- Functional (as opposed to OOP) but not to a fault - OCaml
- Flexible and modular - Module system
- Simple - Few syntactic structures

Currently I'm learning about compilers via Crafting Interpreters and then applying what I learn to Sibyl as well as any additional information I learn from other sources such as books, Reddit, and Youtube.

- Pattern matching
- File IO
- Algebraic Data types
- Dynamic arrays / slices
