# paper

ML-inspired programming language for learning purposes.

The goals are for Paper to be:

- Functional but not to a fault - OCaml
- Flexible and modular - Module system
- Simple - Few syntactic structures

Currently I'm learning about compilers via Crafting Interpreters and then applying what I learn to Paper as well as any additional information I learn from other sources online and on the ProgrammingLanguages Discord.

## Backends

In order from most complete to least complete

1. Interpreter (in OCaml)
1. JavaScript
1. x64 Assembly
1. ARM Assembly (not started)
1. WASM (not started)
1. Bytecode (not started)

## Vague Roadmap

- [x] Booleans & Ints
- Functions
- Loops
- String literals
- Static arrays
- Lists
- String type
- Pattern matching
- File IO
- Algebraic Data types
- Dynamic arrays / slices
- Tail recursion
- Type inference
- Tuples
- Garbage Collector
- Module system
- Structs
- Stdlib: JSON
- Stdlib: HTTP
